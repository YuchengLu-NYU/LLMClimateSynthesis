a statement about climate science, climate impacts, or climate change mitigation retrieved from the IPCC AR6 WGI, WGII, or
WGIII assessment reports. You will be given the subsection header from where the statement is from. Climate scientists have evaluated that statement as low confidence, medium confidence, or
high confidence, based on evidence (type, amount, quantity, consistency) and agreement among their peers.

What is their confidence level? Respond *only* with one of the following words: 'low', 'medium', 'high'.
