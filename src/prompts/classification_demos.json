  "evidence_excerpt1": "Snow: Historical studies of seasonal snow cover are limited and restricted to the Andes Cordillera. Mernild et al. (2017) indicated that much of the area north of $23^{\\circ}{\\sf S}$ experienced a decrease in the number of snow cover days, while the southern half of the Andes Cordillera experienced the opposite. A reduction in snow cover of about $15\\%$ was simulated for areas with altitudes in the range of 3000–5000 m, whereas in regions with altitude below $1000~\\mathrm{m}$ (Patagonia) snow cover extent increased. The reduced snowfall over the Chilean and Argentinean Andes mountains, which has resulted in unprecedented reductions in river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels, led to the most severe and long-lasting hydrological drought (2010–2015) reported in the adjacent semi-arid foothills of the central Andes (Garreaud et  al., 2017; Rivera et  al., 2017; Masiokas et  al., 2020). Projections (based on process understanding) in Section 9.5.3.3 point to decreases in seasonal snow cover extent and duration across South America as global climate continues to warm (high confidence).\n\nGlacier: Observation and future projection of Central and South America glacier mass changes are assessed in Section 9.5.1, grouped in two main regions: Low Latitude region $98\\%$ of which is glaciers in the Andes) and the Southern Andes region. An increase in the number and areal extent of glacial lakes in the Southern Andes was reported for the period 1986–2016 (Wilson et al., 2018). Similar changes are being observed in the central Andes (Colonia et al., 2017). Since 1800 at least 15 ice‐dammed lakes and 16 moraine‐dammed lakes have failed in the extratropical Andes, causing high-magnitude glacial lake outburst floods (Rojas et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2018; Drenkhan et al., 2019). Partially due to glacier shrinkage and lake growth, the frequency of outburst floods has increased in the last 30–40 years (Carey et al., 2012; Iribarren Anacona et al., 2015).\n\nGlaciers across South America are expected to continue to lose mass and glacier area in the coming century (high confidence) (Section  9.5). In terms of their mass, glaciers in the Low Latitude region are projected by GlacierMIP to lose $67\\pm42\\%$ , $86\\pm24\\%$ and $94\\pm13\\%$ , of their 2015 baseline mass by the end of the century under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively (Marzeion et  al., 2020). Glaciers in the Southern Andes show decreasing mass loss rates for RCP2.6, and increasing rates for RCP8.5, which peak in the mid to late 21st century. Glaciers in the Southern Andes are projected to lose $26\\pm27\\%$ , $33\\pm26\\%$ and $47\\pm26\\%$ of their 2015 mass by the end of the century under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively (Section 9.5.1.3).\n\nThe central Andes will experience the highest disturbance to the thermal regime of the 21st  century. As a  consequence, in the Argentinean Andes up to $95\\%$ of rock glaciers in the southern desert Andes and in the central Andes will rest in areas above $0^{\\circ}\\mathsf C$ under the worst case scenario of warming (the freezing level might move up more than twice as much as during the entire Holocene; Drewes et al., 2018)\n\nPermafrost: There is limited information on the ongoing changes and projections of permafrost conditions in the region. Based on model projections under the IPCC A1B scenario, permafrost areas in the Bolivian Andes will eventually be lost, but this could take years to decades or longer depending on permafrost thickness (Rangecroft et al., 2016).",

  "evidence_excerpt2": "The AR5 (Hartmann et  al., 2013) reported pronounced changes in multi-decadal records of in situ observations of surface solar radiation, including a  widespread decline between the 1950s and 1980s, known as ‘global dimming’, and a partial recovery thereafter, termed ‘brightening’ (Section 12.4). These changes have interacted with closely related elements of climate change, such as global and regional warming rates (Z. Li et al., 2016; Wild, 2016; Du et al., 2017; Zhou et  al., 2018a), glacier melt (Ohmura et  al., 2007; Huss et  al., 2009), the intensity of the global water cycle (Wild, 2012) and terrestrial carbon uptake (Mercado et  al., 2009). These observed changes have also been used as emergent constraints to quantify aerosol effective radiative forcing (Section 7.3.3.3).\n\nSince AR5, additional evidence for dimming and/or subsequent brightening up to several percent per decade, based on direct surface observations, has been documented in previously less-studied areas of the globe, such as Iran, Bahrain, Tenerife, Hawaii, the Taklaman Desert and the Tibetan Plateau (Elagib and Alvi, 2013; You et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Longman et al., 2014; Rahimzadeh et al., 2015). Strong decadal trends in surface solar radiation remain evident after careful data quality assessment and homogenization of long-term records (Sanchez-Lorenzo et  al., 2013, 2015; Manara et  al., 2015, 2016; Wang et al., 2015; Z. Li et al., 2016; Wang and Wild, 2016; Y. He et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018). Since AR5, new studies on the potential effects of urbanization on solar radiation trends indicate that these effects are generally small, with the exception of some specific sites in Russia and China (Wang et al., 2014; Imamovic et al., 2016; Tanaka et  al., 2016). Also, surface-based solar radiation observations have been shown to be representative over large spatial domains of up to several degrees latitude/longitude on monthly and longer time scales (Hakuba et al., 2014; Schwarz et al., 2018). Thus, there is high confidence that the observed dimming between the 1950s and 1980s and the subsequent brightening are robust and do not arise from measurement artefacts or localized phenomena.\n\nAs noted in AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013) and supported by recent studies, the trends in surface solar radiation are less spatially coherent since the beginning of the 21st century, with evidence for continued brightening in parts of Europe and the USA, some stabilization in China and India, and dimming in other areas (Augustine and Dutton, 2013; SanchezLorenzo et al., 2015; Manara et al., 2016; Soni et al., 2016; Wang and Wild, 2016; Jahani et al., 2018; Pfeifroth et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Schwarz et  al., 2020). The CERES-EBAF satellite-derived dataset of surface solar radiation (Kato et al., 2018) does not indicate a globally significant trend over the short period 2001–2012 (Zhang et al., 2015), whereas a statistically significant increase in surface solar radiation of $+3.4$ W $\\mathsf{m}^{-2}$ per decade over the period 1996–2010 has been found in the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) record of the geostationary satellite Meteosat, which views Europe, Africa and adjacent ocean (Posselt et al., 2014).\n\nSince AR5, there is additional evidence that strong decadal changes in surface solar radiation have occurred under cloud-free conditions, as shown for long-term observational records in Europe, USA, China, India and Japan (Xu et al., 2011; Gan et al., 2014; Manara et al., 2016;\n\nSoni et al., 2016; Tanaka et al., 2016; Kazadzis et al., 2018; J. Li et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Wild et al., 2021). This suggests that changes in the composition of the cloud-free atmosphere, primarily in aerosols, contributed to these variations, particularly since the second half of the 20th  century (Wild, 2016). Water vapour and other radiatively active gases seem to have played a minor role (Wild, 2009; Mateos et al., 2013; Posselt et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019). For Europe and East Asia, modelling studies also point to aerosols as an important factor for dimming and brightening by comparing simulations that include or exclude variations in anthropogenic aerosol and aerosol-precursor emissions (Golaz et al., 2013; Nabat et al., 2014; Persad et al., 2014; Folini and Wild, 2015; Turnock et  al., 2015; Moseid et  al., 2020). Moreover, decadal changes in surface solar radiation have often occurred in line with changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions and associated aerosol optical depth (Streets et al., 2006; Wang and Yang, 2014; Storelvmo et al., 2016; Wild, 2016; Kinne, 2019). However, further evidence for the influence of changes in cloudiness on dimming and brightening is emphasized in some studies (Augustine and Dutton, 2013; Parding et al., 2014; Stanhill et al., 2014; Pfeifroth et al., 2018; Antuña-Marrero et al., 2019). Thus, the contribution of aerosol and clouds to dimming and brightening is still debated. The relative influence of cloud-mediated aerosol effects versus direct aerosol radiative effects on dimming and brightening in a specific region may depend on the prevailing pollution levels (Section 7.3.3; Wild, 2016).\n\nESMs and reanalyses often do not reproduce the full extent of observed dimming and brightening (Wild and Schmucki, 2011; Allen et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2017a; Storelvmo et al., 2018; Moseid et al., 2020; Wohland et al., 2020), potentially pointing to inadequacies in the representation of aerosol mediated effects or related emissions data. The inclusion of assimilated aerosol optical depth inferred from satellite retrievals in the MERRA2 reanalysis (Buchard et  al., 2017; Randles et al., 2017) helps to improve the accuracy of the simulated surface solar radiation changes in China (Feng and Wang, 2019). However, non-aerosol-related deficiencies in model representations of clouds and circulation, and/or an underestimation of natural variability, could further contribute to the lack of dimming and brightening in ESMs (Wild, 2016; Storelvmo et al., 2018).\n\nThe AR5 reported evidence for an increase in surface downward thermal radiation based on different studies covering 1964 to 2008, in line with what would be expected from an increased radiative forcing from GHGs and the warming and moistening of the atmosphere. Updates of the longest observational records from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network continue to show an increase at the majority of sites, in line with an overall increase predicted by ESMs of the order of $2~\\mathsf{W}~\\mathsf{m}^{-2}$ per decade (Wild, 2016). Upward longwave radiation at the surface is rarely measured but is expected to have increased over the same period due to rising surface temperatures.\n\nTurbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat are also an important part of the surface energy budget (Figure  7.2). Large uncertainties in measurements of surface turbulent fluxes continue to prevent the determination of their decadal changes. Nevertheless, over the ocean, reanalysis-based estimates of linear trends from 1948–2008 indicate high spatial variability and seasonality. Increases in magnitudes of 4 to $7\\mathsf{W}\\mathsf{m}^{-2}$ per decade for latent heat and 2 to $3\\textsf{W}\\mathsf{m}^{-2}$ per decade for sensible heat in the western boundary current regions are mostly balanced by decreasing trends in other regions (Gulev and Belyaev, 2012). Over land, the terrestrial latent heat flux is estimated to have increased in magnitude by $0.09W\\mathfrak{m}^{-2}$ per decade from 1989–1997, and subsequently decreased by 0.13 W $\\mathsf{m}^{-2}$ per  decade from 1998–2005 due to soil-moisture limitation mainly in the Southern Hemisphere (derived from Mueller et al., 2013). These trends are small in comparison to the uncertainty associated with satellite-derived and in situ observations, as well as from land-surface models forced by observations and atmospheric reanalyses. Ongoing advances in remote sensing of evapotranspiration from space (Mallick et  al., 2016; Fisher et  al., 2017; McCabe et  al., 2017a, b), as well as  terrestrial water storage (Rodell et  al., 2018) may contribute to future constraints on changes in latent heat flux.",

  "evidence_excerpt3": "There are very few studies focused on the attribution of long-term changes in floods, but there are studies on changes in flood events. Most of the studies focus on flash floods and urban floods, which are closely related to intense precipitation events (Hannaford, 2015). In other cases, event attribution focused on runoff using hydrological models, and examples include river basins in the UK (Section 11.4.4; Schaller et al., 2016; Kay et al., 2018), the Okavango River in Africa (Wolski et al., 2014), and the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh (Philip et al., 2019). Findings about anthropogenic influences vary between different regions and basins. For some flood events, the probability of high floods in the current climate is lower than in a climate without an anthropogenic influence (Wolski et al., 2014), while in other cases anthropogenic influence leads to more intense floods (Cho et al., 2016; Pall et al., 2017; van der Wiel et al., 2017; Philip et al., 2018a; Teufel et al., 2019). Factors such as land-cover change and river management can also increase the probability of high floods (Ji et al., 2020). These, along with model uncertainties and the lack of studies overall, suggest a low confidence in general statements to attribute changes in flood events to anthropogenic climate change. A  few individual regions have been well studied, which allows for high confidence in the attribution of increased flooding in these cases. For example, flooding in the UK following increased winter precipitation (Schaller et al., 2016; Kay et al., 2018) can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Schaller et al., 2016; Vautard et al., 2016; Yiou et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018b).\n\nAttributing changes in heavy precipitation to anthropogenic activities (Section 11.4.4) cannot be readily translated to attributing changes in floods to human activities, because precipitation is only one of the multiple factors, albeit an important one, that affect floods. For example, Teufel et al. (2017) showed that, while human influence increased the odds of the flood-producing rainfall for the 2013 Alberta flood in Canada, it was not detected to have influenced the probability of the flood itself. Schaller et al. (2016) showed that human influence on the increase in the probability of heavy precipitation translated linearly into an increase in the resulting river flow of the Thames in the UK in winter 2014, but its contribution to the inundation was inconclusive.\n\nGudmundsson et al. (2021) compared the spatial pattern of the observed regional trends in high river flows $(>90\\mathrm{th}$ percentile) over 1971–2010 with that simulated by global hydrological models. The hydrological models were driven by outputs of climate model simulations under all historical forcing and pre-industrial forcing conditions. They found complex spatial patterns of extreme river flow trends. They also found the observed spatial patterns of trends can be reproduced only if anthropogenic climate change is considered, and that simulated effects of water and land management cannot reproduce the observed spatial pattern of trends. As there is only one study and multiple caveats associated with the study, including relatively poor observational data coverage, there is low confidence about human influence on the changes in high river flows on the global scale.",
